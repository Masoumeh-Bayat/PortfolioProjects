--Remove Duplicates

			--When we want to remove duplicates, first we need to identify them> We can use RANK,ORDER RANK,ROW NUMBER

						--Be aware that ROW_NUMBER is a windows Function
							/*A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow
							related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be 
							done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window
							function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows 
							retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to 
							access more than just the current row of the query result.*/
